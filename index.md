# Introduction 
Environment Overflow is a student software engineering team based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. During the spring of 2021, we aim to complete a client request project within three months and this home page will be updated as we progress. As a team, we hope to produce a project that per the request of our client can benefit the community in an impactful way. Thank you. 

# Goal
The goal of this team project is to produce an application with the intent to spark interest regarding the issues of climate change. While tackling the whole issue of climate change during a three-month time frame is quite extreme, we humbly narrow our focus to one specific area of study, vehicles and their use of fossil fuels. Our team goal is to produce an application that is both informative and interactive, something that has an impact that engages the community to produce a positive change.  
Our goal for the application includes the ability for our users to track personal and community level impacts on the statistical values surrounding greenhouse gas emissions. We aim to provide relevant data in the form of close approximations and graphical tools to help our users visualize what kind of an impact they are truly having.

# Use Case

This site is designed for people who are already interested in their environmental impact as well as getting people who aren't yet  interested, interested. Here they can see their impact as well as compare it to others in their community.
