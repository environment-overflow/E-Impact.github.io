# Introduction 
EnvironmentalOverflow is a student software engineering team based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. During the spring of 2021 we aim to complete a client request project within a three month period and this home page will be updated as we progress. As a team we hope to produce a project that per request of our client benefits the community in an impactful way. Thank you. 

# Goal
The goal of this team project is to bring awareness of a specific world issue. While tackling the whole issuing is a bit difficult for a three month project, we humbly narrow our focus to one specific area of study. Our team goal is to produce an application that is both informative and interactive, something that has an impact that engages the community to produce a positive change.
